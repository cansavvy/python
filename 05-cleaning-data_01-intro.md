## Learning Objectives

You have already learned about what tidy data is, why it is important, and how to tidy up a dataset in the main Data Trail course (see [here](https://datatrail-jhu.github.io/DataTrail/cleaning-data.html) for a refresher). After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Reshape a dataset from long to wide or vice versa
- Tidy an existing dataset
- Merge data from different data types
- Manipulate string data
- Manipulate factor data
- Manipulate dates
- Use good practices for managing your project files
